# Heyo, My Name's Marceline üëæ

I make tools.
You can call me Marcy, Marci, Marcie, or Mars.
I use it/its pronouns.

# Skills üåå

My specialties lay in **game engine design**, **graphics programming**,
**virtual worlds**, **software architecture**, and **performance programming**.

I know lots of programming languages: **Rust**, **C/C++**, **Lua**, **Python**,
some shading languages like **GLSL** and **WGSL**, and programming languages
that only compile to **WebAssembly**, such as **Grain** and **AssemblyScript**.
I'm also proficient with build system languages like **CMake**, **Meson**,
**GitHub Actions**, **POSIX and Bash shell scripts**, and **Makefile**.

My favorite things are **Rust**, **Vulkan**, **wgpu**, and **WebAssembly**. I
spend a lot of my spare time finding cool new uses for WebAssembly in desktop
applications.
