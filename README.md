# Heyo, My Name's Marceline üëæ

I make tools.
You can call me Marcy, Marci, Marcie, or Mars.
I use it/its pronouns.

I'm a former ["metaverse" developer](https://github.com/mondradiko/mondradiko), but
have since renounced the name "metaverse" because of its association with Web3 and
(more recently) ~~Meta~~ Facebook. My current efforts are focused on expanding
collaborative virtual worlds software without compromising on free software
philosophy and ideals.

# Skills and Experience üåå

My specialties lay in **game engine design**, **graphics programming**,
**virtual worlds**, **software architecture**, and **performance programming**.

I know lots of programming languages: **Rust**, **C/C++**, **Lua**, **Python**,
**Lua**, some shading languages like **GLSL** and **WGSL**, and programming
languages that only compile to **WebAssembly**, such as **Grain** and
**AssemblyScript**. I'm also proficient with build system languages like
**CMake**, **Meson**, **GitHub Actions**, **POSIX and Bash shell scripts**, and
**Makefile**.

My favorite things are **Rust**, **Vulkan**, **wgpu**, and **WebAssembly**. I
spend a lot of my spare time finding cool new uses for WebAssembly in desktop
applications.

My main project right now is [Hearth](https://github.com/hearth-rs/hearth), a
shared, always-on execution environment for constructing 3D virtual spaces from
the inside. It's inspired by Erlang and Elixir, but uses WebAssembly for the
main scripting language and is written in Rust.

# Philosophy üìñ

I'm a hardcore free software evangelist. I believe that all of the information
relevant to the creation of a person's possessions should be freely available to
them, software or not. I don't think that Richard Stallman went far enough.

The "cloud" doesn't really exist; it's just other people's computers.

I'm strongly opposed to "Web3" development and software such as cryptocurrency and
NFTs. I believe that cryptocurrency-based softwares are parasites on the free
exchange of information because they introduce monetization and artificial
scarcity into an already-functioning informational economy. Also, how the hell am
I supposed to work as a graphics programmer when the crypto farms keep buying all
the damn graphics cards?

# Crabs ü¶Ä

I like crabs because:
- they're cute
- [nature favors them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw)
- the Rust mascost is a crab and I like Rust
- they taste good
