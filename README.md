# Philosophy üìñ

I'm a hardcore free software evangelist. I believe that all of the information
relevant to the creation of a person's possessions should be freely available to
them, software or not. I don't think that Richard Stallman went far enough.

The "cloud" doesn't really exist; it's just other people's computers.

I'm strongly opposed to "Web3" development, and things such as cryptocurrency and
NFTs. I believe that cryptocurrency-based softwares are parasites on the free
exchange of information because they introduce monetization and artificial
scarcity into an already-functioning informational economy. Also, how the hell am
I supposed to work as a graphics programmer when the crypto farms keep buying all
the damn graphics cards?

I'm a former ["metaverse" developer](https://github.com/mondradiko/mondradiko), but
have since renounced the name "metaverse" because of its association with Web3 and
(more recently) ~~Meta~~ Facebook. My current efforts are focused on expanding
collaborative virtual worlds software without compromising on free software
ideals.

# Crabs ü¶Ä

I like crabs because:
- they're cute
- [nature favors them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvfR3XLXPvw)
- the Rust mascost is a crab and I like Rust
- they taste good
